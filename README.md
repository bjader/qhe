### Abstract
The Renyi entanglement entropy (S2) of a bipartite system is a measure of the entanglement between two groups of particles. We build, from scratch, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in C++ capable of calculating S2 for a given trial wave function. The algorithm is verified through analytic and numerical calculations on the free-fermion wave function and then applied to the Laughlin states that describe the quantum Hall effect. For the nominal filling fraction ν = 1 we construct a regime to extract the topological entanglement entropy γ and calculate its value to be γ = 0.0878 ± 0.018. Afterwards, we explore for what reasons this differs from the field theoretic value γ = 0 and suggest solutions to improve the accuracy of our results going forward.
